          <h5 class="card-title">Read and know about the new Harvestor!</h5>
          <p class="card-text text-center text-warning">There's literally tons of things to mention when talking about Harvestor.
            But we need to shorten that! The seller of Harvestor says, "This is a perfectly functioning and 
            easy to use harvestor. Any farmer with a basic technical skill can easily operate this harvestor."</p>
            <h3 class="text-danger fw-bold text-center">
                The sad fact here is that Harvestor is currently unavailable!
            </h3>
            <h3 class="card-title text-center">We know our sellers want their automobiles to get the highest value
                but our customers are searching for good automobiles at a small price. So, we have set the price
                value of Harvestor to only Rs300000! Rs300000 is probably
                the cheapest price that you will get in the market for something as good as the Harvestor!</h3>
